Instant Admin Username Changer is a lightweight WordPress plugin that allows you to instantly change the default admin username and site email without triggering confirmation emails. This tool is perfect for developers, agencies, and WordPress site owners who want to streamline their workflow and enhance security.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Instant Username Change – Update the WordPress admin username safely without creating a new user.

🔒 Why You Need This Plugin

By default, WordPress sends a confirmation email when you try to change the admin email address. This can be a hassle—especially during migrations, development, or when working with temporary emails. This plugin bypasses that process while maintaining security and ease of use.

It’s also a great security step to change the default "admin" username to something more secure.
